title: Where Is Everyone?
---

Migration to America started during the Colonial Era with the pilgrims searching for religious freedom or economic opportunities.
Starting 2010, the UN recorded the migration rates throughout the different continents and they estimated that in 2019, the number of migrants to North America were 59 Million. October 2013, the *Missing Migrant Project* was created to track the numbers of reported migrants found deceased or claimed as missing during migration. I pulled up the data to see out of the so called 59 million people that are moving around the world, how many are actually being tracked between the US and Mexican border. 

# The Biggest Topic of 2019

When you log on to Facebook or any huge news platform, what's the first thing you've seen in 2019? Something about ICE and detention centers or the Mexican border wall, etc. Immigrants being ripped from their families being claimed as undocumented and being held at centers for legal processing. Sensitive topic, I know, my parents are from Vietnam and they came here during the Vietnam war. It was different back then, being on huge boats, landing on Ellis Island and they process your papers right on dock so you can start working. Why is it such a big deal now? I can get into that, but in the end I am not going to bring up politics or go on about my views on this topic. Well, once you see these reports that I am about to show you, you're going to form an opinion of your own. 

# The Data Itself

Below is showing the reported migrants found deceased during migration from 2014 to 2018. I didn't include 2019 because the report was only to March of 2019 and I wanted to show a full year's worth of data.

Now look at the reported missing migrants and see that the report only shows the minimum numbers being reported on a yearly basis.

# Why Are The Numbers So Low?

The report disclosed that there were a lot of ***irregular migrations*** where migrants were taking unknown routes or being transported illegally. Deceased numbers are so low for a yearly report because the cause of deaths were undetermined or only skeletal remains were found. Even some areas they didn't report their true numbers based off no known identification or documentation. Some were lost at sea or trafficked to unknown areas. There are so many logical explanations as to why out of millions of reported Migration numbers are being shown by the UN only less than 500 people are reported as deceased. Even the missing numbers are way below what I expected and therefor this is the purpose of the Missing Migration Project. They believe that its an abused system, ***not surprised***, and people are just ignoring these drastically low numbers. Then it goes into everything just being a big mystery just like every other system out there. Maybe I'm looking at the low numbers all wrong and it may be a good thing that the numbers aren't so high that its worrisome, but lets be real here. What's the real reason the numbers reported for an entire year, as low as it is?
