Just call me **Amy**, born and raised in ***Connecticut since 1992***. I was working in the banking industry for about 6 years and realized that
it's time for a change. Being a Data Scientist was a recent dream of mine after coming across a kid's book that teaches you how to generate a pygame, "Code this Game!" by: Meg Ray, and I've been obsessed ever since. After seeing the hardcore ads of Lambda School, I've decided to apply and after many stressful hours, *while crying*, I completed the precourse assignments. Now here I am, a Lambda DS student, still crying and figuring out this path I chose. 


**Oh right, one of my qualities is being overly dramatic with a hint of severe perseverance syndrome.**
